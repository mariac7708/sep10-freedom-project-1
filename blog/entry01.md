<h2>Marketing and Advertisement</h2>
<main>Hello, my name is Maria Camacho. I am a student who is apart of the three year Software Engineering Program at the Highschool of Telecomunications Art and Technology. Throughout my first year of this program I will be learning the HTML language and learning how to properly use the code taught in this class. By learning HTML, I will be able to create my own website for my year-long project. The topic I choose to focus my project on is Marketing and Advertisement. This topic willed its way towards me because it facinates me that we see maketing strageties and advertisments everyday and are influenced by it whether we realize it or not. Marketing strageties target things like...
<li>Age
<li>Humor
<li>Lifestyle
<li>Problems
<li>Work
<li>Emotion
</li>
to be able to give advertisers the advantage to knowing what group of people to list their product to and how to intrigue them into buying it. Before deciding on marketing, I also considered doing individual researh on Marine Biology but decided not to because Marketing/Advertisement was able to give me a lot of creative freedom on how/what i wanted to put on my web page. 

<h2>Resources For My research</h2>
While researching about Marketing and Advertisement, I looked upon different websites that broke down different marketing strageties and how they work. In this article 
<a href="https://adassoc.org.uk/credos/how-does-advertising-work/"> How Does Advertising Work</a>,
Paul Feldwick he talks about the different marketing strageties used and how advertisement came to be what it is today. He goes into a deeper explanation of how marketing can be used among a group of poeple and how to determine if a specefic group of poeple are a right fit for their product. He also goes into depth about how Advertiseres try to tap into the pshcological aspect of someones mind and think about the questions and concerns one might have about the product to properly and flawlessly get the attention of the targeted audience.
