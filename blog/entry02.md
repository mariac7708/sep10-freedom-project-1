### Why is hardware important?
As of right now, I am teaching myself what there is to know about the hardware aspect of Advertising and Marketing. I know that to be able to market your product, app or website, you have to do it from somewhere and create that your vision on a canvas. The canvas being a physical piece of technology. I have learned that to make what your advertising appealing to a large audience, it must include certain factors that'll help encapsulate the attention of the audience. People love to see something meaningful, silly or sentimental. In <a href="https://deksia.com/blog/branding/marketing-attention-tips" alt> "this website"</a> I was able to learn what holds the attention of people when being shown something new. This is extremely important because the human attention span has currently gone down to 8 seconds. Meaning that the individual will have 8 seconds to decide if your brand is worthy of their time and money, and what they might retell about your brand. To want to capture the audiences attention means that you'll have to create an advertisement with good display quality and video quality, good source of internet connection and have colors that the audience would want to look at.

### Engineering Design Process
#### Laptops
As I read from the website <a href="https://socinova.com/hardware-for-social-marketers-heres-what-you-really-need/" alt> "Hardware for Social Marketers-Heres What You Really Need" </a>, I learned that you need a good laptop or desk top computer that is able to support heavy multitasking and be able to switch from different tabs, windows and websites swiftly. This will allow you to work efficiently with minimal distractions. What is also stated is that you must have a device that is portable and that you can bring with you everywhere. Having something thin and light weight would be of good use to you physically and be more convienient to you. 

#### Digital billboards
Everyday we take a look at atleast one advertisement a day, it's inevitable. What we don't realize is where we see them and how frequently it is that we do see them. Everyday, about 4 million people in New York use public transportation to get from place to place. Many travel to the city for work and other errands. As you walk on the street you'll see many different digital billboards pass you and you might unconciously take a glimpse of it and stray your focus towards it. This is the power of color, clarity and emotion. These billboards get people to give their attention to it, watching or reading what is displayed on it. It is also great how generally big they are to us which would allow people from afar or with defected eye ivision to see your brand and what it stands for.

### Skills
Since my blog entry 1, I have learned that to readers who are viewing my work for the first time can find it difficult to understand what it is I am talking about or what I am describing with out context. I need to make my work understandable for all even if it is already thorough to me. Since then I have tried to write out my work with context on my topic and spell out abbreviations to make it easier for others to read and process. Breaking it down will allow people to understand the point I am trying to get at and how I've made it here.
